        "\n",

        "\n",
        "  You may find out that there exists a space (or a tab) at the beginning of the second line, which is called indentation. Different from other languages, Python is very strict about using the indentation because it recognize the hierarchy of the code through indentation. For example, all codes having one space (or tab) after the line \"`with open(f_path, 'r') as f:`\", which doesn't have a space at its beginning, are operated inside the situation of the line \"`with open(...`\".\n",
        "\n",
        "    Although there is no restriction about what you should use (that means your code will run whaterver you use between spaces and tab, as long as consistently use it), the standard indentation norm in Python is four spaces, as I will use the examples.\n",
        "    You can set up the indentation spaces to four spaces as your default by setting at \"Tools\" (among the above menu) -> \"Settings\" -> \"Editor\" -> \"Indentation width in spaces\" -> Setting up as \"4\".\n",
        "\n",
        "    Since we are reading the file under the situation where the file is opened, we write our `read()`, `readlines()`, or `readline()` code after the indentation. When you will learn conditional statement, iteration, and exception, you will become familiar with indentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Oh, one super important thing about indentation is __consistency__! For example, if you decide to use a space as your indentation, you must keep using a space without changing it to a tab in the middle of your code. That is, one code has one indentation system consistently. Help your Python understand your code easily!\n",
